# Camunda Lafayette Optimize
This is a spring boot application containing the Camunda Platform preloaded with the Lafayette tutorial processes.
It can used to step through the Camunda Optimize video tutorial. 

You'll need to have Java JDK 11 installed. 
To run it just open the `CamundaPlatformAndDB` folder, open a terminal window and run the executable jar with the following Command

```
java -jar Lafayette-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-spring-boot.jar
```

This will startup the Platform. Once it's started you can access the webapp by going to ``localhost:8080/`` and login using `demo` / `demo`
